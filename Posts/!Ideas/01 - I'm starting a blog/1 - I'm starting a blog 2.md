# I'm starting a blog! ....and this is my first post


## Introduction

Hello! My name is Andrew Yule. My background is in chemical engineering and I've worked in the oil and gas industry for nearly 10 years. While you may not necessarily describe my work as "data science", I use many of the same techniques to handle and process data and I am passionate about the technology and the revolution that's going on with data.

## So, why am I starting a blog?

My goal with this blog is to:

1. Provide a way to help share interesting things I've learned and / or worked on.
2. Help others to see the power in 
	a.) Data Science and also
	b.) Wolfram Language (#WolfLang) for data science
3. Improve my technical writing skills and ability to share messages

## What will this blog focus on?

It's hard to say for sure given that I've just decided to start this. However, I think it's safe to say that a lot of posts will have a general focus on data science with plenty of emphasis on Wolfram Language (Mathematica) as it is my preferred computational tool. I have general interests in R and Python as well but just with much less actual working knowledge of their syntax and usage.

## Something technical

I can't have my first post be just text, so here's some small technical content...

One of my favorite people to follow on YouTube and Twitter is David Robinson (@drob). While he's a very well known R user and contributor, I've found that his posts are very interesting and generally appeal to a larger data science audience.

He posted something interesting a while back on twitter (with a link to his own blog) about coin flips probabilities that I thought was pretty cool. 

There are a few questions in his full write up, but the first is something along the lines of .... **How many times on average do you need to flip a coin to get two heads in a row?**

To solve it, he takes a tidy data approach in R. While that's interesting,
