# Piping hot functions

## What makes data science focused programming languages unique?

Data science is one of the buzz words in many industries right now and oil and gas is certainly no different. When thinking of data science, probably the most likely things that come to mind are big data and machine learning. **To me, however, the phrase data science more generally refers to the ability to extract useful information from data.**

The key to this information extraction from data - and arguably the true *data science revolution* - has been the tools developed that enable working with data easier. Thinking specifically about programming languages like Python, R, and Wolfram Language.

What makes these languages unique is they focus less on creating very low-level structures or algorithms, and instead focus more on performing high-level computations on objects and abstracting away the details for the user.

There are countless examples 

## What is a pipe?

I wanted to focus on one very small feature of computational languages that separate them from the more traditional computer programming languages

## Examples in R

While R did not invent the idea of the pipe operator, it has likely helped to make it the most famous and uses it more than most other languages.

The basic syntax is this:

`data %>% function1` 

which can be read as "take data and apply function1 to it". However, the value of the pipe operator becomes more apparent as the complexity of the computation grows. For example:

`data %>% function1 %>% function2`

can be read as "take data, apply function1, then apply function2 to that result".
