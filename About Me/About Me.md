# About me and this blog

Hello and thanks for visiting my blog! My name is Andrew Yule. My background is in chemical engineering and I've worked in the oil and gas industry for nearly 10 years. While you may not necessarily describe my work as traditional "data science", I use many of the same techniques to handle and process data and I am passionate about the technology and the revolution that's going on with data.

### So, what's the point of this blog?

My goal with this blog is to:

1. Provide a way to help share interesting things I've learned and / or worked on.
2. Help others to see the power in data science and what tools and techniques are available
3. Improve my technical writing skills and ability to share messages
