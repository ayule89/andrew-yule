#### About me
I'm a chemical engineer with 10+ years of experience working in the oil and gas industry. My interests include flow assurance, data science, statistics, and programming in the Wolfram Language and Python.

#### Code
- [ggplot](https://github.com/ayule89/ggplot) (for Wolfram  Language): This is a Wolfram Language implementation of the popular R package called ggplot. It's one of my favorite side projects, but unfortunately I don't get as much time to work on it as I would like.
- [wl2md](https://github.com/ayule89/wl2md): Converts a Mathematica notebook into a Markdown notebook. It's essentially a re-write of the m2md package ([link](https://github.com/kubaPod/M2MD)), as I wanted a little more control over the code base and implementation.
- [andrew-yule](https://github.com/ayule89/andrew-yule): Repository for the majority of the content that makes up this website.
